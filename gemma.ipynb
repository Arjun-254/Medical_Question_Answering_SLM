Juvenile HD is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner, which means that one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. An affected person usually inherits the altered gene from one affected parent. As the altered HTT gene is passed from one generation to the next, the size of the CAG trinucleotide repeat often increases in size. A larger number of repeats is usually associated with an earlier onset of signs and symptoms (anticipation). A larger number of repeats is usually associated with an earlier onset of signs and symptoms. Most often, children with juvenile HD inherit the expanded CAG trinucleotide repeat from their fathers, although on occasion they inherit it from their mothers.<end_of_turn><eos>\"}\n"

This can result in vision changes, such as blurred vision, halos around lights, and blind spots. Glaucoma is usually caused by an increase in eye pressure, which can be caused by a variety of factors, including age, race, family history, eye surgery, and eye trauma. While glaucoma can affect people of all ages, it is more common in people over the age of 50. This is because the optic nerve is especially susceptible to damage as we age.\n",
